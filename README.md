# Description
A simple dynamic web app made in Angular to serve as the frontend for my Minecraft server wrapper project.       
Current features:
- Live server console
- Buttons for starting and stopping server
- Indicators for minecraft server status, and backend program status
- Information about host PC    

**Installing/Using**   
- npm install
- Change the API url (src/app/constants.ts) to the host machines API url
- ng serve
- Visit the machines IP in your browser     
This is just for testing, but it's definitely possible to build a distribution and deploy that to any HTTP server.
